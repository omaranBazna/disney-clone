# Disney website clone

#In this project I cloned Disney website using React Js , firebase ,Redux.

#For styling my project,I used styled components which enabled me to create more complex styles smoothly.

#I used react-router for routing management so my whole App is SPA which give the best user experience.

#I used react-slick and react-slides to add the slide effect to the hero section.

#For the database ,I used firebase collections to store all movies data.

#For user authorization ,I used firebase Google provider.

#I used Redux Js for state management to made my app more reliable and testable.

#The App architecture is totally scalable and testable ,we can easily add new movie with full details.

#The code is well documented ,clean ,commented ,divide into separate modules and components and easy to understand.

#I used Git&GitHub for version control.
